Yellow everyone ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Since my first line of code at age 11 that I thought computer engineering would be my future, but I studied civil engineering instead! Later came Jazz.

But I was always thinking about programming... So I took a code bootcamp at <Academia de CÃ³digo\_> that prepared me to become a full stack developer.

Some tech stacks learned:

| Languages  | Frameworks |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Java       | Spring     |
| Javascript | Hibernate  |
| HTML       | Bootstrap  |
| CSS        | JUnit      |
| SQL        | Mockito    |

...and more.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Spring Framework, going deeper.

ðŸ”­ Very soon, I'll study C# to get used to the .NET world and then React...

âš¡ Fun fact: In the course of the bootcamp there were two Brunos, then one day someone randomly decided that I was "Fake" and the other "True" Bruno. The funny thing is that I exist, but the other one was just a creation of the Matrix. True Story!
